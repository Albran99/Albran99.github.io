    </ul>
    <p>Epidemic Broadcast is an epidemic simulation built using C++ in Omnetpp. The simulation represents a network of interconnected nodes, where each node has peer-to-peer connections. Within this network, each node has a probability of transmitting an "infection message" to its neighboring nodes. The objective of the simulation is to identify the optimal configuration that maximizes the spread of the epidemic.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>SecureBank is an application designed to implement the transfer of messages and data between a client and a bank server in a secure way. The protocol designed is resistant to both replay attacks and subquantum passive ones. For simplicity purposes, it is assumed that both parties already know the other's public key</p>

    <p>In this project I was tasked with analyzing two set of malware, the first one is of Iranian origin and it steals sms messages to allegedly steal OTP code, the second one is an adult themed app that tracks the user, subscribe him to paid SMS services and could also act as ransomware. The last one in particular had an extensive use of code obfuscation </p>

    <p>SecurePos is a fully comprehensive project, starting from user specifications, the objective is to build a functional factory of micro-services to classify POS transaction and signal the malevolent ones. The project has a strong focus on the whole road-map with milestones and meetings with the client. In addition the project is done in such way to be module independent to make future addition of features and changes easier to implement.</p>

    <h3> AI for violence detection in CCTV </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python </li>
      <li> Tensorflow </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The objective of the project is to build from scratch a CNN that receives as input CCTV footage and classifies it into two main categories: violence and non violence presence. The study starts with a very simplCNN and follows it up with a continuous improvement of performances and hyper-parameter tuning and test with both 2D and 3D CNN. In addition a comparison will be made with pre-trained neural network such as Resnet with the following case study.</p>

    <h3> NoiseMapper </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Kotlin </li>
      <li> Android </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Noisemapper is a mobile application designed to facilitate indoor positioning and environmental noise mapping. Leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for indoor localization, the app captures ambient audio data from the userâ€™s surroundings. This data is transmitted to a central server where it is stored with data from other users. The app then is able to generate comprehensive noise maps, providing insights into the acoustic landscape of various indoor environments. Users can access these maps to make informed decisions about noise levels in specific rooms.</p>
